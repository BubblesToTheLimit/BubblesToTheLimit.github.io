      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I spontaneously attended a presentation on AWS security. The talk was highly interesting! The presenter showed his personal involvement with the topic, while the content was up-to-date, well chunked, extensively researched and battle-tested. During the Q&amp;amp;A at the end of the presentation though, the presenter got picked apart. The questions all double-checked whether the presenter was as good as he seemed. They were all aimed at finding a technical mistake in the slides, or intended point out a missed opportunity for improvement. This Q&amp;amp;A session really slapped it in my face: &lt;em&gt;The dimension of decency in tech.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
