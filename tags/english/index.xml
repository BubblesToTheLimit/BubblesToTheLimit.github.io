      <description>&lt;p&gt;My emacs now behaves differently when I&amp;rsquo;m at home! This enables me to have my private configuration loaded automatically when needed, while I have all my work-settings enabled otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I gobbled down two chicken-halves and some mashed potatoes. That was a lot. The other time I was still hungry after a single half, and this time around I was stressing out over barely finishing the meal. I needed to sit down for a bit. I picked a sunny spot. Me being me I took some time to meditate and suddenly I had an epiphany: &amp;ldquo;We are afraid of ourselves, and that is what life is.&amp;quot;. Believe me, this was not the chicken talk, but I had finally figured something out. Let me elaborateâ€¦&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, a couple cute Mormon missionaries came over to me and chatted me up. I estimated the three of them to be roughly my age, probably a couple years younger, around 22 to 23. It was a beautiful, sunny Saturday and I incidentally was sitting on a bench near a church. Later they told me they are specifically roaming these areas to do their work. They started out the conversation talking about their strong belief in god, how they talk to him, and how he would answer them their questions. They proceeded asking me what questions I had for god. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have one and couldn&amp;rsquo;t even come up with one, but I was interested in chatting with them, so I invited them to sit down with me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tinder Manifesto</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Manifesto: noun. A public declaration of policy and aims, especially one issued before an election by a political party or candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinder could get dirty. Tinder could get tedious. I wrote down my original aims when I started using tinder here, before everything falls into chaos later. Much like with other manifestos ;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is pretty important for each of us to be the person we want to be. &lt;em&gt;For survival, for&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;society, for integrity. But what do we know then about who we want to be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The three most important skills to have as a young adult</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The skill to change your habits&lt;/strong&gt;, so you could start trying new ones (better or worse than your current ones) to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The skill to build the desire of trying things truly out of your comfort zone&lt;/strong&gt;, so you could expand your horizon and thereby change more of your habits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The skill of writing&lt;/strong&gt;, so you could articulate what it is that you want. Also writing can be a great tool for changing your habits.&lt;/li&gt;
